=== Setup ===
- https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideJetResponseAnalyzer#Install_Run

=== Run JRA on pp sample ===
--sample specific--
- scripts/runjra.sh ppjra_tree.root
  * input: a jra tree with only pp jet collections
  * output: jra histograms
- script/runjrahi.sh hijra_tree.root
  * input: a jra tree with both pp and hi collections
  * output: jra histograms
- Notes
  * We apply weights at this time when go from tree to histograms
  * The histograms can then be merged b/c no calculations have been done yet, only just turning from tree to histos

--jra standard--
- At this point all data are in jra histograms, we work with these, no matter where they came from
- scripts/plotRspRes.sh
  * input: jra hisotgrams
  * output: tgraphs of relative jet reponse and relative resolution as a function of pt
